# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Excel as a Microsoft Office 
program. The project started from the basics like topics ranging from renaming files to saving charts. Gradually, all of the techniques that would be needed to be successful at using Excel were tested. It was to also show that a student would be able to work with pivot tables, charts, and various different functions. This particular project was based around finding out how different campaigns performed compared to the funding they were allotted and and the days they were launched. 

## Analysis and Challenges and Results

Since I have had previous experience with using Excel, I still stumbled upon a couple 
difficulties when trying to complete this project. Getting the pivot tables to show exactly what was needed took a bit of fidgeting with where to put what. I also found myself having trouble with the countifs function. Having multiple filters made it slightly confusing when trying to find the number failed, successful, and canceled. I did not expect any of the plays to have been canceled which made me recheck my work a couple of times. The commas, parenthesis, and quotes while filtering the data resulted in many errors. It was also very tedious to change the formula for each and every field, but once I got the hang of it, it was pretty straightforward. 

Outcomes Based on Launch Date Graph (see pdf)

When taking a look at the graph presented above, it could be seen that plays that were released during the summer months had the best outcomes. The lines for successful and failed plays can be seen moving relatively parallel to each other. It could also be concluded that plays at the very end and very beginning of the year have a greater chance of having a bad outcome. These months just do not attract much attendance at plays. The slower months show a small trend as well where one of the highest rates of a bad outcome. The best time to release a play if you want the best outcome is around the end of April and beginning of May. That is the best launch date since the other months do not have as much of a spike in the graph as these months.

Outcomes Based on Goals (see pdf)

This graph kind of shows a trend that just because there is a big goal, that there will be a great outcome as well. Some of the movies that had the lowest goals have seen the biggest successes. It can also be seen that goals can be set too high. After the 50,000 point there was a sharp decline. There is a sweet spot that can be seen around the 25,000 mark. Plays with goals around that area had seen relatively great success. The success matched the levels of plays that had small goals. There were not necessarily any limitations in the data set. There was a lot that could have been done with the data with a trained eye. These were also all in English and the data did not really grasp it on a global perspective. This case could be completely opposite somewhere at the other side of the world where the beginning and end of the months would have the greatest outcomes. I think that there could have been better tables and graphs that could have been generated using the data that was given. The duration of the play could have had an impact on the outcome of the play as well. People do not necessarily like to spend hours at a show. A graph comparing the durations and the outcomes could have given us a different view as well.
